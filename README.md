# Password Generator

Created with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I made a desktop and a tablet version.

You can enter a value from 1 to 50 and then press button Start. If you enter a number greater than 50, the input field will automatically leave the number 50. 
The password will be generated. It will be shown 7 different passwords in each row.
